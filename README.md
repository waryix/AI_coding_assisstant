AI Coding Assistant Widget

A discreet, always-on-top desktop widget that provides AI-powered code solutions for technical interview questions. Built with Electron and powered by the Gemini API.

Features
Discreet Interface: A small, frameless window that can be placed anywhere on your screen.
Always-On-Top: Stays visible over your IDE, browser, or video call application.
Adjustable Transparency: Make the widget almost invisible to blend in with your background.
Multi-Language Support: Generate optimal code solutions in Python, C++, or Java.
Secure API Key Storage: Uses a .env file to keep your API key safe and out of the main codebase.
Hidden from Taskbar: The application does not appear in the Windows taskbar or macOS Dock for maximum discretion.
